# Google Spreadsheets Api Demo

This demo app demonstrates how to integrate the Google Sheets API into your application to perform insert operations on a spreadsheet without requiring client-side authentication and authorization. The focus of this implementation is to enable server-to-server communication, allowing insert operations to be executed without the user's awareness.

## Run locally

### Step 1 - Clone the project on your desktop.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AyuPatidar/google-sheets-api-demo.git
```

### Step 2 - Move the downloaded "service-account.json" file inside the server directory.

### Step 3 - Fill the spreadsheet id in your server.js file.

### Step 4 - Run the server

```bash
  cd server
  npm i
  node server.js
```

### Step 3 - HTML File
